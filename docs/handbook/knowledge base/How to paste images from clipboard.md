# How to paste images from clipboard

You can paste an image from the clipboard with `cmd+alt+v`.

Images are automatically copied to the `/docs/attachments` folder and a reference is added in the file where you pasted them.

A prompt will ask you to confirm the name of the image, to disable it set `"pasteImage.showFilePathConfirmInputBox": false,` in the settings.

For more info check the [vscode-paste-image](https://github.com/mushanshitiancai/vscode-paste-image) extension page.
