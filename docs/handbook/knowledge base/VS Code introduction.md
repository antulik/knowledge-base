# VS Code introduction

VS Code is a powerful text editor, hidden behind a simple interface. VS Code supports various keyboard shortcuts. These are the most important ones which you will be using all the time:

- ++cmd+p++ - use quick-pick to open a file
- ++cmd+shift+p++ - invoke a command ([read more](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette))
- ++cmd++ + `Click` - navigate between notes

Other handy shortcuts

| Shortcut        | Action                |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| ++cmd+n++       | create a new file     |
| ++cmd+s++       | save the current file |
| ++cmd+shift+f++ | search in repo        |
| ++cmd+shift+e++ | open File Explorer    |

## Panels

You can see a few panels on the left, including:

- **Outline**: shows you the structure of the file based on the headings
- **Timeline**: shows git log for the opened file
- **Backlink**: shows links pointing to the opened file

## Settings

To view or change the settings in VS Code, press ++cmd+comma++. Watch out, there are User and Workspace preferences. Workspace preferences are shared across all developers.
